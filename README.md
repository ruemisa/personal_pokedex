POKEDEX

Welcome to my pokedex which displays only three pokemon evolutions of Eevee. I am still trying to make it as dynamic as possible so that I can display a variety of pokemon in the future. So, it is still a work in progress.

Notes to consider:

* I have 3 .js files (the oldest version is stored in the xtra folder).

* I worked on the main.js file in the v2 branch for a while just so I dont mess up the old file.

* Just switch between main.js and test.js(still working on it). Addition instructions are commented on the .html file

* Having trouble with the pokemon API. Didn't transfer on a public server. I mean, it does work for me after a few refreshes.

* Need to fix the layout and design. Planning to completely remove the materialize.css framework (required) and create my own grid system.


Don't hesitate to critique my work. I am new to this and still learning so it will really help guide me into the right direction.

Enjoy.
